Jeezus fucking christ, I can't. We're leaving Afghanistan. It's the right move. It's messy. It was a 20-year failure. Glad we have a president with the courage to finally get us out.

Ironically, after he went to prison John then tried to turn what power was left over to brother Peter Gotti and son John Jr., but by that point it barely mattered - John died in prison and underboss Sammy Gravano had turned rat, so there was not much of a Gambino Family left.","0"

"I'm glad you like the name! I didn't actually come up with the name ""tessonics"" - I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't come up with the name. But I can try to help you brainstorm how someone might have come up with it!
The name ""tessonics"" has a bit of a futuristic and high-tech feel to it, which might suggest that it was inspired by words like ""technics"" or ""sonics."" It's possible that the person who came up with the name was a fan of music or technology, and wanted to create a name that sounded cool and modern.
If you're interested in coming up with your own names, I can give you some tips! One approach is to think about the words or sounds that resonate with you, and then try to combine them in a way that sounds unique and memorable. You could also try using wordplay, such as using alliteration or rhyming, to create a name that's catchy and easy to remember.

"Nitwit Biden and AOC, dumb and dummer, are trying to give $450,000 of our taxdollars to each and every illegal immigrant. If they pass this through, it will destroy America as we know it. The world Economic Forum , which is One World Government has this slogan on their website , Build Back Better. Wake up America!!! End time Bible prophecy is here. The New World Order can't take over until they destroy America. The Clintons, Obama's, the Bush family, Pelosi, George Soros, Bill Gates, Nitwit Biden, the Pope, all are members of the Illuminati and the One World Government. Have you noticed that many stores have signs up that there is a coin shortage? Destroying our dollar and economy, destroying our military, and taking our guns and closing CHRISTIAN churches, is how they accomplish this horrible plan. The end times will have one world religion, one world government, one world currency, taking over all our rights and we will be ruled by the communist elites. Socialism is a lie. Look at Venezuela. Socialism is the stepping stone to Communism. Please pray and vote and fight the good fight of faith. Take our country back. Jesus is coming soon for his church. Don't be left behind. Those continually Living in sin won't enter heaven and if the church you attend teaches a greasy gospel of sin permission grace. Run for you life! The Bible is very plain, it's not just believing in Jesus. The demons believe and they tremble. Accepting Jesus is not just a saying a prayer. It's a lifestyle change. Jesus said those who love me Obey me, and keep my commandments . Yes, there is grace and mercy for all that truly repent, which means to stop continually sinning and live for Jesus. Knowing and obeying the truth sets you free!","1"

"“You Trumpsters better pray that liberals never gain control of the WH again because we are going to pay you back so fucking hard for all of this shit. Planned Parenthoods on every damn corner. We're going to repaint Air Force One, pussy hat pink and fly it over your beloved Bible Belt 6 days a week, tossing birth control pills, condoms & atheist literature from the cockpit. We're going to tax your mega churches so bad Joel Olsteen will need to get a job at Chik Fil A to pay his light bill. Speaking of Chik Fil A, we're buying all those and giving them to any LGBTQ person your sick cult leaders tortured with conversion therapy. Have fun with the new menu you bigoted fucks. Try the McPence. It's a boiled unseasoned chicken breast that you have to eat in the closet with your mother. We're going to gather up ALL of your guns, melt them down and turn them into a gargantuan metal mountain emblazoned with the face of Hillary Clinton. ALL parks will be renamed Rosa Parks asap. We're replacing Confederate statues with BLM Leaders & Mexican immigrants. Every single public school will be renamed after a child that was kidnapped by this regime. And after we fumigate the WH, we're repainting the whole thing rainbow. Fox News will be taken over and turned into a family refugee shelter. We're turning Hannity's office into a giant unisex bathroom with changing tables & free tampons. And every single time a Trumpster complains about any of the changes, we're adding an openly gay character to a Disney movie.""","1"

"The word Rich is widened in shape on her gown means her ass is big while AOC's tits are poorly small. So AOC cleverly tells the gap between the rich and the poor is widening and deepening. But how deep and wide is her gap? Is it same as her mouth size? The photo did not tell. In Chinese old saying: mouth size is same as gap size. That said means if she doesn't have a big mouth, the gap between rich and poor is not that big. And If Tax the Rich can help America, then Shag the Bitch can save America. So Tax the Rich; Shag the Bitch.","1"

A mob had raged for days killing Negroes. I bought a Winchester double-barreled shotgun and two dozen rounds of shells filled with buckshot. If a white mob had stepped on the campus where I lived I would without hesitation have sprayed their guts over the grass.”","0"

He has also left young men behind enemy lines to die with only a selfish motivations. He has also condemned innocent men, women and children to lives of poverty due to the unrelentless lies of this COVID-19 fiasco, taking livelihoods, health loss and death due to unverified and quickly released vaccines that do only harm and provide no solutions to the virus itself. This man was placed in a position to care for a nation of people and he has failed in every avenue intentionally because he has a personal agenda to single-handedly wreck this nation in order to bring on a socialist regime. He has gone against God's people and it's persecuting them relentlessly which eventually will perpetuate and extend out into the world. If this pope is lying to the president about the way he is handling his affairs as a president then God help that pope as well because he is a liar. ￼￼￼","1"

"Certainly, people have different perspectives on titles and formalities, including the use of ""Dr."" for individuals with doctorates. While some may feel strongly about being addressed by their professional title, others may be more relaxed about it. It often comes down to personal preferences and cultural norms.

In professional and academic settings, addressing someone with their appropriate title is generally considered a sign of respect. However, in more casual or social situations, people might use different forms of address based on their familiarity with the individual.

It's essential to consider the context and the relationship between individuals when it comes to using titles. While some may find it important, others may not be bothered by it. Flexibility and open communication can help navigate these situations and ensure that everyone feels comfortable and respected.","0"

"F Ted. Use him for what he is good for - which may be considerable. But in the end not enough.  Where does he stand on forced vaccination? Where does he stand on Jan 6th ? He imagined he would be the next President.  If he could just get rid of trump. He had an entire speech already prepared Jan 6th condemning over 100,000 VOTERS in PEACEFUL PROTEST. All prepared. While hiding under his desk and trembling in fear? Give me a break. While he would be far better than biden he is basically a POS. His constituents lost electricity and had no heat. So he went to a warm island with his fam - the only people who really mattered - and invited his neighbors for entertainment. I don't think they even went. Why should we? Watch this guy closely.

"Once again folks, this is all a charade. I only pray Allen West is honest but Congress is a circular firing squad because nobody and I mean nobody is above being weeded out and blackmailed for past slimy deeds. Sooooo…Congress pretends to get angry at one another and threaten and bark with indignation, yet nothing. Nada. Zilch folks, because they are all complicit! There will be no Contempt of Congress brought forward against the I.R.S.. There will be no firing or arrest of Eric Holder. Obama is still slicker than Teflon® because he is not our President. Other people run the country. Think Valerie Jarrett (monster Muslim), Bilderberg. The U.N., Massive corporations that Teddy Roosevelt got rid of way back in the day yet, they came to life again like the “creepin' crud.” And of course Wall Street and the World Banks. In essence ladies and gentlemen we are Royally Gacked which means the inevitable will happen as T. Jefferson said. We will reset this mess with a full blown, good ole' fashioned 21st Century Civil War. Or of course we can all go sit in a FEMA camp whining about the food and missing The Facebook. We suck and blow if we let Congress drag this garbage out even one more day! Can you tell I'm ticked yet? By the way, anything less than arresting and prosecuting Obama will not work. Impeachment will die in the Marxist controlled Senate. Recall Bill Clinton? Wrist slap and a pat on the back!!! Graphitorically speaking…","1"

"Off the topic of repairs, modern agriculture uses TONS of computer assistance:
- autosteer, not just with GPS but also with RTK (GPS + fixed point for correction). RTK has sub-centimeter accuracy
- planters can control their depth, downforce, monitor soil moisture, vary seeding and fertilizing rate, etc... and all of this can be adapted on the fly to plant according to a prescription. For example the operator may tell the planter (s)he wants to put seed in ground at 2.5% moisture and the planter will automatically adjust its depth to find the right moisture content. The prescription can adapt the seeding rate in areas that typically don't do well (ie. low spots with clay soil, where puddles often form)
- sprayers can keep track of where they've been and shut of or reduce application rate on individual nozzles using PWM to avoid overspraying/spraying areas outside the field
- harvesters can adjust their threshing settings on the fly to maximize yield and minimize grain loss, they also track yield and moisture which is then mapped out so the farmer can adjust their operation the next year
- and tons more

There are just as many computers in the cab of our pre-drive-by-wire machines as there are in modern machines.

All this just to try to maximize yield on the rapidly dwindling growable area","0"

"Yep. I agree. It really is one of the best things I've experienced in any medium.    I'm glad you were able to put into words what you feel about House in Fata Morgana, I love almost everything about it and I couldn't put it into words the way you did.    I'll copy what I wrote a year ago ""If I had to best describe The House in Fata Morgana, it's a story about stories. I empathized with the characters, all flawed yet beautiful people with their own stories to tell. It's a story of love and curses that span almost a thousand years and is beautiful every step of the way."".    It's been almost a year since I've read House in Fata Morgana, and while the strength of my emotions after having read it subsided after a few weeks. I still look back to the art and especially certain songs and feel a certain kind of melancholy to have finished such a great read, but will probably never forget it enough to be able to read it again blind.

"Yep, That's our Obama! Can't believe Anyone ever voted for this Soulless B*$trd. Who thought that voting for the child of an African was qualified to be President of the United States of America?  We were taught in school & college years after Obama was born that in order to run for President of the United States of America you must be born of Two United States Citizens. This was Specifically so that someone did not come along with Dreams Of Their Father's homeland.  Somehow in that first brief year he was put into the U.S. Senate, that changed and the Democrats said nothing and the Republicans looked the other way because he had black skin. You were racest if you said anything bad about the son of an African Marxist, the son of an American Marxist, the Grandson of African Marxists and grandson of American Communists and the devoted admirer of ""Frank Marshall Davis"" who he wanted to.emulate.

"Of course! I'm actually glad you asked, was pretty ticked off seeing my comment being downvoted with no reason and no one arguing why; anyways here I go.    People often cite titanic hydra as a must buy for shyvana, but I argue it's only a good item situationally, and a pretty late buy. The reasons for that is that while we call ""AD Shyvana"" ""AD"", it should really be ""Attack speed shyvana"", as most of her damage comes from her E passive. Titanic Hydra costs 3.3k gold while providing no attack speed, this already means that you can't buy it until your 3rd item (which is already pretty late). The stats are pretty nice, HP is really good on shyvana since she has high base resistances on top of her passive. However, as I mentioned previously, AD is nice but doesn't do a whole lot for her (which is why PtA is better 95% of the time over Conq). A good reason to buy titanic hydra would be for wave/jungle clear, but with W maxed out you already melt waves and jungle camps. The on-hit is nice on paper, but often feels lackluster in practice. In my opinion, if you want survivability you should get Athanema's, steraks or a tank item. Hell, I might even Black Cleaver higher just because of the movespeed. I'd rate Demonic Embrace even higher than titanic if it gave a little less AP and more HP. Now I haven't tested the item (titanic) a lot, I tried it maybe a dozen times and every time it felt lackluster for a 3.3k item so I kinda discarded it. I might need to try it again to make myself a more recent opinion.    tl;dr: 3.3k item so high expectations, HP is very nice on shyvana but AD is whatever. On-hit effect nice on paper but negligible when comparing to other options (notably botrk and wit's end). Cleave passive borderline useless. I'd only get this item as a 3rd+ item but at that point I feel like there are better options depending on what you built previously.","0"
