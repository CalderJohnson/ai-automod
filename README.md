# AI Powered Discord Message Flagging

In the CSS discord, we provide a space where students can discuss almost any topic freely with each other. However, there are a few types of dialog we do not allow because they can potentially lead to negative exchanges, create an unwelcoming environment, or violate university regulations/the law.

We do not allow:
- Racism, sexism or any other kind of intolerance or discrimination.
- Trolling, comments intentionally inciting conflict, malicious personal attacks, spam, and sexually explicit content.
- Trading of pirated or illegally acquired materials.
- Cheating on individual assessments.
- Political/controversial talk.

Our moderation team is committed to upholding these regulations and ensuring we maintain a respectful and positive environment for everyone. In order to assist with these efforts, we are employing an AI powered sentiment analyzer that will flag potentially problematic messages for us. It's a BERT finetune, and its training pipeline is contained within this repository.
